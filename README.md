## About The Project

Simple Sudoku Solver app that helps you solve Sudoku puzzles by taking a photo of the puzzle and show the solved puzzle. It uses OpenCV to process the image and detect the grid, while a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model extracts and recognizes the numbers in the grid. After that, the app solves the puzzle and shows you the completed solution.
